# Mobile App Development Assignment
## What is this?
This is a university assignment where I was tasked with creating a mobile app (using Android Studio) with multiple fragments and persistent storage.

## I can't find the code
The kotlin is buried in Mobile-App-Development-Assignment/yhproject/app/src/main/java/android/cs/stir/ac/uk/yhproject/

## What mark did you get for this?
For both the report and project, I scored 72%. I think the report dragged this mark down, as feedback for the app was noticably better; it started with "An excellent implementation. The work done fulfills all basic criteria as well a number of advanced ones."
